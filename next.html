          <p>Hi Stella ðŸ‘¤  <br> i might probably not know what the catch is cos' we've not been together for some while, and I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to share something that's been on my mind lately, and I hope you'll hear me out with an open heart. Over the time we've spent together, you've become an incredibly important person in my life. Your kindness, your laughter, and your warmth have brought so much joy and meaning into my days. I cherish our friendship deeply, and I'm grateful for every moment we share.
 
          
Lately, though, I've found myself thinking about our connection in a different light. I've come to realize that my feelings for you have grown beyond just friendship. I admire you not only as a friend but as an incredible person with qualities that resonate deeply with me.ðŸ’¯
          <br> 
          I understand if this comes as a surprise, and please know that I value our friendship above all else. I'm sharing this because I believe in honesty and openness, and I want you to know how much you mean to me. Whatever your feelings may be in return, I respect and cherish our bond, and I'm committed to supporting and being there for you, no matter what. <br>
           Please take all the time you need to process this, and know that I'm here whenever you're ready to talk. Our friendship means the world to me, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this journey with you, whatever form it may take.<br>
          With love and appreciation.ðŸ’¯
          </p>
